File Metadata Microservice
=========================

**Objective**: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: [https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/](https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/) and deploy it to Glitch.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story**: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

**User Story**: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

**Hint**: You may want to use this package: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)
